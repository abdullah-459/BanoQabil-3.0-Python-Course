I have created python program that take Blood Pressure as input from user 
And give following instructions based on Blood pressure 
If blood pressure is from 80 to 100 : Take some fresh juice  And rest
If Blood pressure is from 100 to 120 ; Its Excellent
If blood pressure is from 120 to 140 :Its a bit high Take a long breath
If blood pressure is from 140 to 160 ;Take some rest and drink plenty of water
If blood pressure is from 160 to 180 ; Consult a doctor and take medicine 
If blood pressure is from 180 to 210 ; Immidiately visit the nearest clinic or hospital and take the supervision of a Doctor.
This program takes bp from user and give these instructions based on the bp
